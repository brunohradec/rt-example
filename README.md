# Redux Tookit example

This is an example of how Redux Tookit can be used to handle state 
and API calls in a React project.

Most of this was done following this quickstart guide:
https://redux-toolkit.js.org/tutorials/quick-start

To run the project, run the example API available here:
https://github.com/brunohradec/rt-example-api

And then run:
```bash
npm run dev
```
